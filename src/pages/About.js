        hello I'm Yogi Surya Pranata, I'm from Indonesia. I really like
        engineering, especially mechanics, electricity and computers. I am very
        interested in programming because with programming I can realize my
        dream to help others. My favorite style of web development is mobile
        first with a minimalist design.
